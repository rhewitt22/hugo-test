<h2 id="restoring-the-gulf-of-mexico-and-its-wild-inhabitants">Restoring the Gulf of Mexico and its Wild Inhabitants</h2>

<p>The Gulf of Mexico is critically important to the health and vitality of our nation&rsquo;s natural and economic resources. Over the last century, however, the Gulf&rsquo;s environment has deteriorated significantly due to factors such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Climate Change</li>
<li>Sea-level rise</li>
<li>Loss of critical wetlands and coastal habitats</li>
<li>Decreasing water quality and quantity</li>
<li>Invasive species</li>
</ul>

<p>Natural disasters like hurricanes, and man-made disasters like oil spills, exacerbate the damage.</p>

<p>As a result, native fish and wildlife populations and their habitats are in decline, imperiling the very fabric that supports the area&rsquo;s vibrant economy. In order to achieve a healthy Gulf of Mexico, the Service recognizes conservation must occur throughout the greater Gulf watershed. Society&rsquo;s investment in the Gulf of Mexico will be at risk if we restore the coastal region but fail to address systemic problems that originate upstream.</p>

<p>Restoring this vital area will ensure America continues to thrive well into and beyond the 21st century.</p>
